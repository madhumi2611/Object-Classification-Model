<b> PS2:Classification of different superhero /animefigurines using Image Classification </b>
 <hr>
 Collecting superhero and anime figurines is a popular hobby among enthusiasts,
 with a wide variety of characters and designs available. Deep learning algorithms,
 specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have the potential to
 accurately identify the different superhero and anime figurines from images. This
 helps in classification of large-scale collections, ultimately enhancing the
 collector experience and supporting inventory management.
 In this problem, prepare a proper dataset with annotations of images containing
 various superhero and anime figurines by using the given dataset or by web
 scraping techniques. Your goal is to develop an algorithm that can automatically
 classify these images into their respective categories based on the figurine
 character.
 <br><br>
 Dataset:
 The dataset must consist of a collection of images of superhero and anime
 figurines from different sources. Each image should be labeled with the name of
 the character the figurine represents. The dataset should include images with
 varying lighting conditions, backgrounds, and figurine poses. Corresponding
 ground truth annotations should specify the classification labels for each image.
